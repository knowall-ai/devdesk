/**
 * Kanban column / DevOps state reconciliation.
 *
 * The stand-up board renders a fixed set of display columns (New, To Do,
 * Active, Blocked, Resolved, Closed) that is really a *union* across every
 * process template in the org. Any individual work item can only ever enter
 * the states its own work item type defines — an Agile-template Bug has no
 * "To Do" state at all — so a column that is valid for one card is invalid
 * for another. Dropping onto an invalid column makes DevOps reject the PATCH
 * with a workflow rule error (TF401320) and the card silently snaps back
 * (issues #391, #366).
 *
 * These helpers let the board ask "can *this* card go in *that* column?"
 * before offering the drop target.
